# Salesforce Modeling dbt Package ([Docs](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_salesforce/))

# 📣 What does this dbt package do?
- Produces modeled tables that leverage Salesforce data from [Fivetran's connector](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/salesforce) in the format described by [this ERD](https://fivetran.com/docs/applications/salesforce#schema) and builds off the output of our [Salesforce source package](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_salesforce_source).

- This package enables users to:
  - Understand the performance of your opportunities
  - Drill into how the members of your sales team are performing
  - Have a daily summary of sales activities 
  - Leverage an enhanced contact list
  - View more details about opportunity line items

This package also generates a comprehensive data dictionary of your source and modeled Salesforce data via the [dbt docs site](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_salesforce/)
You can also refer to the table below for a detailed view of all models materialized by default within this package.

|**model**|**description**
-----|-----
| [salesforce__manager_performance](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_salesforce/#!/model/model.salesforce.salesforce__manager_performance)     |Each record represents a manager, enriched with data about their team's pipeline, bookings, losses, and win percentages.
| [salesforce__owner_performance](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_salesforce/#!/model/model.salesforce.salesforce__owner_performance)         |Each record represents an individual member of the sales team, enriched with data about their pipeline, bookings, losses, and win percentages.
| [salesforce__sales_snapshot](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_salesforce/#!/model/model.salesforce.salesforce__sales_snapshot)               |A single row snapshot that provides various metrics about your sales funnel.
| [salesforce__opportunity_enhanced](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_salesforce/#!/model/model.salesforce.salesforce__opportunity_enhanced)  |Each record represents an opportunity, enriched with related data about the account and opportunity owner.
| [salesforce__contact_enhanced](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_salesforce/#!/model/model.salesforce.salesforce__contact_enhanced)  |Each record represents a contact with additional account and owner information.
| [salesforce__daily_activity](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_salesforce/#!/model/model.salesforce.salesforce__daily_activity)  |Each record represents a daily summary of the number of sales activities, for example tasks and opportunities closed.
| [salesforce__opportunity_line_item_enhanced](https://fivetran.github.io/dbt_salesforce/#!/model/model.salesforce.salesforce__opportunity_line_item_enhanced)  |Each record represents a line item belonging to a certain opportunity, with additional product details.

# 🎯 How do I use the dbt package?
## Step 1: Pre-Requisites
You will need to ensure you have the following before leveraging the dbt package.
- **Connector**: Have the Fivetran Salesforce connector syncing data into your warehouse. 
- **Database support**: This package has been tested on **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **Redshift**, **Databricks**, and **Postgres**. Ensure you are using one of these supported databases.
  - If you are using Databricks you'll need to add the below to your `dbt_project.yml`. 

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

dispatch:
  - macro_namespace: dbt_utils
    search_order: ['spark_utils', 'dbt_utils']
```
- **dbt Version**: This dbt package requires you have a functional dbt project that utilizes a dbt version within the respective range `>=1.0.0, <2.0.0`.
## Step 2: Installing the Package
Include the following salesforce package version in your `packages.yml`
> Check [dbt Hub](https://hub.getdbt.com/) for the latest installation instructions, or [read the dbt docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/package-management) for more information on installing packages.
```yaml
packages:
  - package: fivetran/salesforce
    version: [">=0.7.0", "<0.8.0"]
```
## Step 3: Configure Your Variables
### Database and Schema Variables
By default, this package will run using your target database and the `salesforce` schema. If this is not where your Salesforce data is, add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
    salesforce_database: your_database_name    
    salesforce_schema: your_schema_name
```

### Disabling Models
Your connector may not be syncing all tabes that this package references. This might be because you are excluding those tables. If you are not using those tables, you can disable the corresponding functionality in the package by specifying the variable in your `dbt_project.yml`. The metrics from the disabled tables will not populate in downstream models. By default, all packages are assumed to be true. You only have to add variables for tables you want to disable, like so:

The `salesforce__user_role_enabled` variable below refers to the `user_role` table. 

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
config-version: 2

vars:
  salesforce__user_role_enabled: false # Disable if you do not have the user_role table

```
The corresponding metrics from the disabled tables will not populate in the downstream models.

## (Optional) Step 4: Additional Configurations
### Change the Source Table References
Source tables are referenced using default names. If an individual source table has a different name than expected, provide the name of the table as it appears in your warehouse to the respective variable: 
> IMPORTANT: See the package's source [`dbt_project.yml`](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_salesforce_source/blob/main/dbt_project.yml) variable declarations to see the expected names.

```yml
# dbt_project.yml
...
config-version: 2
vars:
    <package_name>__<default_source_table_name>_identifier: your_table_name
```
### Salesforce History Mode
If you have Salesforce [History Mode](https://fivetran.com/docs/getting-started/feature/history-mode) enabled for your connector, you will want to add and set the desired `using_[table]_history_mode_active_records` variable(s) as `true` to filter for only active records as the package is designed for non-historical data. These variables are disabled by default. 
```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
vars:
  using_account_history_mode_active_records: true      # false by default. Only use if you have history mode enabled.
  using_opportunity_history_mode_active_records: true  # false by default. Only use if you have history mode enabled.
  using_user_role_history_mode_active_records: true    # false by default. Only use if you have history mode enabled.
  using_user_history_mode_active_records: true         # false by default. Only use if you have history mode enabled.
  using_contact_history_mode_active_records: true      # false by default. Only use if you have history mode enabled.
  using_lead_history_mode_active_records: true         # false by default. Only use if you have history mode enabled.
  using_task_history_mode_active_records: true         # false by default. Only use if you have history mode enabled.
  using_event_history_mode_active_records: true        # false by default. Only use if you have history mode enabled.
  using_product_2_history_mode_active_records: true    # false by default. Only use if you have history mode enabled.
  using_order_history_mode_active_records: true        # false by default. Only use if you have history mode enabled.
  using_opportunity_line_item_history_mode_active_records: true       # false by default. Only use if you have history mode enabled.
```
### Change the Build Schema
By default, this package builds the GitHub staging models within a schema titled (<target_schema> + `_stg_salesforce`) in your target database. If this is not where you would like your GitHub staging data to be written to, add the following configuration to your root `dbt_project.yml` file:

```yml
models:
    salesforce_source:
      +schema: my_new_schema_name # leave blank for just the target_schema
```
### Adding Passthrough Columns
This package allows users to add additional columns to the `opportunity enhanced` model and `contact enhanced` model. For the `opportunity enhanced` model, columns passed through in `opportunity_enhanced_pass_through_columns` must also be present in the upstream source `opportunity`, `account`, `user`, or `user_role` table. If you want to include a column from the `user` table, you must specify if you want it to be a field related to the opportunity_manager or opportunity_owner.

Additionally, you may add additional columns to the staging models. For example, for passing columns to `stg_salesforce__product_2` you would need to configure `product_2_pass_through_columns`.

```yml
# dbt_project.yml

...
vars:
  opportunity_enhanced_pass_through_columns: [account_custom_field_1, my_opp_custom_field, user_role_custom_field_1, opportunity_manager.user_custom_column_1]
  account_pass_through_columns: [account_custom_field_1, account_custom_field_2]
  user_pass_through_columns: [user_custom_column_1,user_custom_column_2]
  contact_pass_through_columns: [contact_custom_field_1, contact_custom_field_2]
  opportunity_pass_through_columns: [my_opp_custom_field]
  lead_pass_through_columns: [lead_custom_field_1, lead_custom_field_2]
  task_pass_through_columns: [task_custom_field_1, task_custom_field_2]
  event_pass_through_columns: [event_custom_field_1, event_custom_field_2]
  product_2_pass_through_columns: [product_2_custom_field_1, product_2_custom_field_2]
  order_pass_through_columns: [order_custom_field_1, order_custom_field_2]
  opportunity_line_item_pass_through_columns: [opportunity_line_item_custom_field_1, opportunity_line_item_custom_field_2]
  user_role_pass_through_columns: [user_role_custom_field_1, user_role_custom_field_2]
```

## (Optional) Step 5: Adding Formula Fields as Pass Through Columns
### Adding Formula Fields as Pass Through Columns
The source tables Fivetran syncs do not include formula fields. If your company uses them, you can generate them by referring to the [Salesforce Formula Utils](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_salesforce_formula_utils) package. To pass through the fields, add the following configuration. We recommend confirming your formula field models successfully populate before integrating with the Salesforce package. 

Include the following within your `packages.yml` file:
```yml
packages:

  - package: fivetran/salesforce_formula_utils
    version: [">=0.6.0", "<0.7.0"]
```

Include the following within your `dbt_project.yml` file:
```yml
# Using the opportunity source table as example, update the opportunity variable to reference your newly created model that contains the formula fields:
  opportunity: "{{ ref('my_opportunity_formula_table') }}"

# In addition, add the desired field names as pass through columns
  opportunity_pass_through_columns: ['formula_field_1','formula_field_2']
```

## (Optional) Step 6: Orchestrate your models with Fivetran Transformations for dbt Core™
Fivetran offers the ability for you to orchestrate your dbt project through the [Fivetran Transformations for dbt Core™](https://fivetran.com/docs/transformations/dbt) product. Refer to the linked docs for more information on how to setup your project for orchestration through Fivetran.
